# Foldables Demo
Various demonstrations of APIs and libraries for foldable devices.

## Running the demos
The code of this branch is the output of a new project using Android Studio's default template. To see the available demos, list the available branches like this:
```sh
git branch -a
```

Then, pick a branch and switch to it like this:
```sh
git checkout origin/<branch>
```

Once you have checked out the desired branch, open the project in Android Studio and click run. It is recommended to use one of the emulators with a foldable screen or, if you have one, a physical foldable device.
